_placeholder - something like 'example visualised tif datasets from which geographical covariates were extracted in a 2500m buffer around pond locations. how many and what covs were included. where they came from_

_placeholder - something about total counts across all years for counties and pond locations [whether GCN were found or not]. some key bullet points about the method, and key takeaways - good/bad locations_

_add html interactive map? I spent ages on that..._

_placeholder - METHODS for training best model, then fine tuning that model for the highest accuracy. explain best model, explain FIV, explain predicted vs actual performance. 

_add in image of model performances. MAYBE screenshot the iterative combination of variables as well as model testing. FIV. pred vs act_

_placeholder RESULTS_

_image of differences and increases - explain the results_

# Great-Crested-Newt-UK-Pond-Analysis
Surveyed pond data by Natural England/Defra is analysed for location patterns via the use of machine learning models

_placeholder something like - a brief detailing the descriptive analysis (what happened) Diagnostic analysis (why it happened) Pdictive analysis (what will happen) rescriptive analysis (what steps to take). the script is inteded to used via the scheduled task manager on a windows remote desktop and function as an automated report. it can be expanded with SQL datawarehousing (script to be added soon) or ported directly to an Altair python dashboard _

_add html interactive map? I spent ages on that..._

_explain method something like 'geographical covariates were extracted in a 2500m buffer around pond locations. how many and what covs were included. where they came from_

_placeholder caption example visualised tif datasets_

_placeholder - something about total counts across all years for counties and pond locations [whether GCN were found or not]. some key bullet points about the method, and key takeaways - good/bad locations_





_placeholder - METHODS for training best model, then fine tuning that model for the highest accuracy. explain best model, explain FIV, explain predicted vs actual performance. 

_add in image of model performances. MAYBE screenshot the iterative combination of variables as well as model testing. FIV. pred vs act_

_placeholder RESULTS_

_image of differences and increases - explain the results_
